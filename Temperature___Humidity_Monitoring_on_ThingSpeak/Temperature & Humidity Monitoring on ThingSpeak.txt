#Temperature & Humidity Monitoring On ThingSpeak

## Description
Monitor temperature and humidity using DHT11/DHT22 sensor and upload data to ThingSpeak for real-time visualization. Learn sensor interfacing, HTTP requests, and IoT data monitoring.

## Components Required
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- DHT11 or DHT22 Sensor
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## Circuit / Connections
- DHT Data pin to D4
- VCC to 3.3V
- GND to GND

## How to Use
1. Replace `YOUR_WIFI_SSID`, `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_THINGSPEAK_WRITE_API_KEY` in the code.
2. Upload `ESP8266_ThingSpeak_DHT.ino` to NodeMCU.
3. NodeMCU connects to Wi-Fi and sends temperature & humidity data to ThingSpeak every 20 seconds.
4. Open ThingSpeak channel → view real-time data graph for temperature and humidity.
